              An educator at heart, writer and developer by trade. Oh, and I LOVE cannabis.

              I have been involved in the cannabis industry and community since 2016. Using my Le Cordon Bleu pastry knowledge I began my self-education journey by making edibles for myself and friends. With lots of encouragement I submitted my best product, infused macarons, to The Karma Cup competition, where I won 2nd place.

              In 2017 I began working in medical cannabis clinics, helping patients get access and educating them on products.I took that love of education and soon began writing for various publications, including the OCS and Cannabis Retailer Magazine.
