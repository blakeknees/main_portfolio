             From 2017-2020 I worked in medical cannabis clinics, helping patients obtain prescriptions and educating them on products. Using what I learned in clinics, I turned to my experience as a writer to publish articles and email marketing for many cannabis publications and companies, including the OCS, Cannabis Retailer Magazine, Tremblant and Emblem.
