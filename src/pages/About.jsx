              I have been involved in the cannabis industry and community since 2016. Using my Le Cordon Bleu pastry knowledge, I began my self-education journey by making edibles for myself and friends. With lots of encouragement I submitted my best product, an infused lemon macaron, to The sKarma Cup competition. I won 2nd place.

              From 2017-2020 I worked in medical cannabis clinics, helping patients obtain prescriptions and educating them on products. Using what I learned in clinics, I turned to my experience as a writer to publish articles and email marketing for many cannabis publications and companies, including the OCS, Cannabis Retailer Magazine, Tremblant and Emblem.

             Recently I have moved away from working in cannabis full-time, but I still love creating content about it on the internet. Specifically breaking the stigma that you can't be productive and use cannabis (follow me on Instagram to learn more).
